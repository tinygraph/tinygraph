          <h2>Graph Format</h2>
          <p>
            We use a compressed sparse row format to represent graphs in compact and efficient ways: ideal for large scale and high-performance use-cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trade-off is limited support for modification. The use-cases we support: build a graph, work on the graph, and potentially build new graphs from there.
          </p>

          <h2>Graph Compression</h2>
          <p>
            For compression we use techniques like: succinct data structures, storing deltas in vbyte format, and permuting graphs based on space filling curves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compressed graphs not only have a much smaller footprint, but we also keep an eye on viability and practicality: this is not a research project.

          <h2>Modern Hardware</h2>
          <p>
            Vector instruction sets are widely deployed with AVX2 available for 10+ years by now: we target modern hardware for efficiency gains at no cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide scalar fallbacks and baseline implementations in case vector instructions are not supported: at the cost of runtime efficiency.

          <h2>Stable Library</h2>
          <p>
            We provide a stable API and ABI using semantic versioning: a stable ABI allows for simple shared library upgrades across minor versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of the stable API and ABI we provide bindings to other languages: they come with their own stability and support guarantees.

          <h2>Graph Interchange File Format</h2>
          <p>
            We provide a file format for storing large graphs effectively and efficiently and for sharing graphs in a portable way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tinygraphio file format stores a directed (or bidirectional) graph in a compressed sparse row format for a compact representation.
            The on-disk representation of the compressed sparse row graph is based on Protocol Buffers.
